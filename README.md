# Threat-Research

## MOTRA

## Sie Process Hollower
An exploration in the Process Hollowing Attack Vector.  Taking it one step further allowing a dynamic approach to hollowing out another process is the goal vs some of the vectors that have a pre-defined shell code to inject.

## Swifted
An exploration into a "non-malicious" evasion trojan using hidden windows, adding itself to your startup, triggering other processes and updating your windows desktop background with a "Swift" implementation.  Harmless unless Taylor Swift is not your cup of tea.
